      	  	<h3>About Me</h3>

      	  	<p> I graduated from <a href="http://www.mitpune.com/">MIT, Pune </a> in 2015 majoring in Computer Science. When they were teaching civil and mechanical engineering courses in my first year, I was self-learning Java and built my very first android app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapp.tasbeeh"> tasbeeh.</a></p>

            <p> After college I started working for <a href="https://bookmyshow.com"> bookmyshow </a>, a ticketing platform. Worked on projects involving technologies like NodeJS, PHP, .NET and AngularJS.  Open sourced some of my work there including a <a href="https://github.com/Riser101/php-rmqlib">php wrapper for amqp based rabbitmq library.  </a></p> 
            
            <p>Over the years, I have adopted, mastered and moved on from many languages, frameworks and architectures. I currently focus on PHP heavy web application development.</p>
